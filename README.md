Purpose
========

To enjoy speed-cubing via a fast, clean, simple, terminal-based-GUI game

Personally,
* To learn git (commands, website, explore other projects, collaboration, etc) 
* To explore python curses (fast screen printing, mouse control, keyboard input, and windows) 
* To better my (our?) python project management
* To use numpy for (probably) no good reason
* To attack a problem many have so easily tackled before but in a (probably) dumber, slower, and uglier way
