termCube
========

A terminal-based NxNxN cube game (curses speedsolving/speedcubing)

Purpose
========

To enjoy speed-cubing via a fast, clean, simple, terminal-based-GUI game

Personally,
1. To learn git (commands, website, explore other projects, collaboration, etc) 
2. To explore python curses (fast screen printing, mouse control, keyboard input, and windows) 
3. To better own python project management
4. To use numpy for (probably) no good reason
5. To attack a problem many (52 pages of links) have so easily tackled before, but in a (probably) slower, uglier, and dirtier way
