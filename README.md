termCube
========

A terminal-based NxNxN cube game (curses speedsolving/speedcubing).

NOTE: This is an in-progress, hobby project with flexible goals/end-dates.

Purpose
========

To enjoy speed-cubing via a fast, clean, simple, terminal-based-GUI game.

And personally for a lurning experience, in order to:

  1. Learn git (commands, website, explore other projects, collaboration, etc) 
  2. Explore python curses (fast screen printing, mouse control, keyboard input, and windows) 
  3. Better own python project management
  4. Use numpy for no exceedingly good reason
  5. Attack a problem many have so easily tackled before, but in a (probably) slower, uglier, and dirtier way

Version
========
